<p>South Station is a modest little building, representing in its style
of construction a typical railroad station in the days when the
railroad first came to the Miami Valley. However, its function is
not to provide a waiting place for passengers but to serve as the
home of one of the oldest locomotives still in existence. The miniature
power house across the way is much more modern in its construction.
The Corliss engine which has been re-erected in this
building was in operation at NCR for almost fifty years.</p>

<p>When James Watt gave the world the condensing steam engine
in 1788 he ushered in an era in man&rsquo;s progress which brought
with it the Industrial Revolution and fundamental changes in
our way of life. Steam has made possible the development of our vast
industries, our modern transportation on land and on sea, and an immeasurable
expansion of the horizons of our daily life.</p>
<p>Two of the most far-reaching uses of the principle of production of
power through steam have been in transportation and in the generation
of electricity. In both instances the first steps toward the ultimate
achievement were crude and none too convincing, but they did lead to
further development and outstanding accomplishment.</p>
<p>After the discovery of the power of steam, man toyed with the idea of
a steam engine that could move itself. The implications of such an
invention were far reaching. The first steps were taken in England in the
early part of the nineteenth century and a locomotive which successfully
hauled a train of vehicles was built there in 1825. The first American
locomotive was the Tom Thumb built by Peter Cooper.</p>
<p>In a competition sponsored by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,
Phineas Davis, a watchmaker of York, Pennsylvania, built a locomotive
which was referred to as the &ldquo;grasshopper&rdquo; type because of its appearance
and the up-and-down motion of its driving rods. This was really
the first successful steam railroad engine in this country.</p>
<p>Turning to the stationary steam engine for the production of direct
power and for generating electricity, we find that the greatest advance
in this field was the Corliss engine. This engine which incorporated new
principles of control and fuel economy was the invention of George H.
Corliss, a New England inventor who, as much as any other man, was
responsible for the development of the power facilities which have made
possible the industrialization of this nation.</p>
<p>The Grasshopper locomotive and the Corliss engine, each in its own
way, made a vital contribution to the development of America. Each is
included in the Carillon Park exhibits because it represents a significant
forward step in man&rsquo;s constant quest for a better and fuller life.</p>

</div>
<p>The steam railroad represents an evolution unique in the story of
man&rsquo;s progress. Its expansion from almost primitive beginnings unfolds
one of the epics of transport. Today&rsquo;s network of steel rails is tribute to
the originality and persistency of courageous and far-seeing men.</p>
<p>Nowhere has the railroad undergone such a transformation as in the
United States. Although England stood in the van of locomotive construction,
American ingenuity perfected the most powerful type. From
an average of twelve to fourteen tons, the weight of the first Grasshopper
engine, they have expanded to the monsters of more than five
hundred tons. In 1840, a little more than a decade after the incorporation
of our first railroad, the total mileage in this country was 2,810.
Today the operated mileage is 398,000.</p>
<p>The real birth of the railroad, however, was in England. As in the
United States, tramways provided the predecessor. They were first
employed in the coal districts adjacent to Newcastle, to convey coal
from the pits to the River Tyne for shipment abroad.</p>
<p>The weakness in all the early British engines was that they could not
produce steam as rapidly as they used it up, nor did they have sufficient
power to move quickly, or pull more than their own weight. It remained
for George Stephenson to overcome these weaknesses and prove the
practicability of the movable steam locomotive. Stephenson, born in
1781, was the son of a fireman at the Wylam Colliery near Newcastle.
Stirred by the story of James Watt&rsquo;s achievements in the domain of
steam, George enrolled in a night school to study mechanics.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>Steam traction continued to absorb the attention of many British
inventors, so Stephenson turned to it. He constructed an engine called
&ldquo;Blucher,&rdquo; which made a successful trial run July 25, 1814.</p>
<p>George Stephenson was a persistent fellow. To his doggedness of
purpose we owe the beginning of the steam railroad. In 1822 he &ldquo;sold,&rdquo;
as we would say today, the directors of the Stockton &amp; Darlington
Railway, which had planned to use horses on its trams, on the idea of
using a steam locomotive. He was appointed engineer of the road and
given authority to carry out his plans.</p>
<p>The age of railroading in this country began with the chartering in
1827 of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, the first road constructed in
the United States to carry passengers and freight. The first rails were
laid on July 4, 1828, with Charles Carroll, the only living signer of the
Declaration of Independence, turning over the first spadeful of dirt.
The first section of thirteen miles from Baltimore to Ellicott&rsquo;s Mills was
opened in May, 1830. The man who jolted the Baltimore &amp; Ohio
directors out of their horse fixation was the renowned Peter Cooper.</p>
<p>Cooper built a locomotive which he called Tom Thumb. The name
was apt because it was quite a small affair. In its construction he used
odds and ends of mechanical parts. The barrels of muskets, for example,
provided the tubes for the upright boiler.</p>
<p>The directors of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio decided to have a competition.
In January, 1831, they advertised for locomotives to be entered
in a series of contests. They offered to give a $4,000 prize for the locomotive
that best met the test, and $3,500 for the second best engine.</p>
<p>Four engines entered the competition, one of which was built by
Phineas Davis, a watchmaker of York, Pennsylvania. The Davis entry
fulfilled all the requirements of the competition and won first prize.
Soon after its adoption the Baltimore &amp; Ohio directors named that
type of locomotive the Grasshopper. This was due to its grasshopper-like
construction. From that parent engine sprang a fleet of Grasshoppers
that operated for nearly a century and made railroad history.</p>
<p>Phineas Davis and his partner, Gartner, now began to develop the
Grasshopper type. The next venture was the Atlantic which went into
service on the B &amp; O in the summer of 1832. Once the Grasshoppers
demonstrated their utility, the steam locomotive idea spread rapidly.</p>
<p>The saga of the American Railroad is a stirring narrative of triumph
over obstacles. The road of the iron horse is part of the larger highway
over which progress has marched. In that drama of achievement the
Grasshopper locomotive played its full part. As such, it merits a niche
in the Transport Hall of Fame.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="b smaller">The Grasshopper locomotive now placed in Carillon Park chose
to tell its own story of its origin, its experiences, its hopes, its fears
and its present feeling. With the assistance of Lawrence W. Sagle
of the B &amp; O staff, Old No. 1 here tells its story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boy, what a relief to have your future definitely settled! Especially
if you have worked hard for 57 years, and then been pushed around for
an additional 55 years, fearful all the time that you may be cut up for
scrap. You can appreciate how I feel, now that I have a nice cozy home
here at Carillon Park in Dayton, Ohio.</p>
<p>What say? Oh, of course. Let me introduce myself. I am old Grasshopper
Locomotive No. 1. And the oldest original B &amp; O locomotive in
existence. That, alone, is something to be proud of! And do I have a
long and colorful history? Let me tell you about some of its highlights.</p>
<p>I was built way back in July, 1835, one of a group of improved grasshopper
locomotives then being placed in service on the B &amp; O. We fellows
were really good in those days. The old &ldquo;Atlantic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Traveller&rdquo; had
been retired the year before I was built. Just between us, they weren&rsquo;t
much to speak of. We new engines, named for Presidents of the United
States and other great statesmen, could run rings around them. I was
proud to be named the &ldquo;John Quincy Adams.&rdquo; And there was the
&ldquo;George Washington,&rdquo; for instance. He led the parade of the first trains
into Washington, D. C., on August 25, 1835&mdash;and I was second in line&mdash;to
make railroad history. He finally ended his career out around Wheeling,
Va., in 1853. He had hauled rail cars down the line as the railroad
was pushed eastward to Roseby&rsquo;s Rock, where the tracks were joined on
December 24, 1852. Good old George! I wish he could have lived to see
me now, snug as a bug in my new home.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to pardon my ramblings. You know how we old fellows
like to look back and talk about the &ldquo;good old days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, time passed, and then we were more or less pushed into the
background by the newer, more powerful locomotives that came along.
I&rsquo;ll never forget the first Winan&rsquo;s Camel. Gosh, what a fright he gave
me! I thought he would topple over and crush me. But I soon got used
to those big fellows. And then, in 1850, they took my distinguished
name away from me. Imagine how I felt being just plain No. 6, instead
of &ldquo;John Quincy Adams.&rdquo; But I kept on working as if nothing had
happened although I was no longer in main line service. I felt very
diminutive compared to the Mud-diggers and Camels. And in 1884,
they changed me to No. 1. Well, that was better! I was the oldest locomotive
on the B &amp; O. That was something to be proud of, even then.</p>

<p class="pcap">The John Quincy Adams proudly bearing the number &ldquo;1&rdquo; bids goodbye to Mount Clare
Station on eve of departure for Carillon Park.</p>
</div>
<p>So things drifted along until there were only four of us left. There
was old &ldquo;Andrew Jackson&rdquo; (built in February, 1836), &ldquo;John Hancock&rdquo;
(built in April, 1836) and &ldquo;Martin Van Buren&rdquo; (built in November,
1836), all good, stout fellows. All four of us were doing switching duty
at the Mt. Clare Shops in Baltimore. And, although we were numbered
1, 2, 3 and 4, when in our stalls at night, we called each other by our
old names. John, Andy, Marty and I (they called me &ldquo;J.Q.&rdquo;) would
talk far into the night about the early days of the railroad and how
little those newer, bigger locomotives seemed to know&mdash;or care&mdash;about
such things.</p>
<p>Well, sir, things drifted along until one day in 1892 a group of distinguished
men dropped around and looked us over. There was one
chatty old fellow with a goatee, who seemed to have some plans for
our future. I learned later that he was Major Pangborn, and what he
did to me shouldn&rsquo;t have happened to a Mud-digger! He took us all into
the shop, worked on us for days and&mdash;of all things!&mdash;altered me to resemble
the &ldquo;Traveller&rdquo; and altered &ldquo;Andy&rdquo; to resemble the &ldquo;Atlantic,&rdquo;
two old boys that couldn&rsquo;t pull your hat off in a mild windstorm! What
a come-down! But old &ldquo;Marty&rdquo; got the worst treatment of all. He was
altered to resemble that old &ldquo;crab&rdquo; locomotive, the &ldquo;Mazeppa,&rdquo; with
dummy horizontal cylinders and his beautiful grasshopper legs ripped off.
Oh, the ignominy of it all! John fared better than the rest of us. He got
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
a new coat of paint and a new name. They painted &ldquo;Thomas Jefferson&rdquo;
on his cab. That, in a way, was a sad blow to us also. Old Tom had
passed on in 1860, but we all remembered him fondly. We were a confused
lot of locomotives, I can tell you!</p>
<p>But we were not long in learning what it was all about. They loaded
us on some gondola cars&mdash;imagine the sensation of riding on a railroad
car, pulled by another, bigger locomotive, when, all of your lifetime had
been spent in pulling cars yourself&mdash;and for several days we travelled
over rails we had never seen before. Boy! What mountains and grades
we crossed. I doubt if I could have pushed a single car up some of them
and I admired greatly the brute strength of the big fellow on the head
end of our train and the one that pushed on the rear end.</p>
<p>We finally reached Chicago, and were placed on exhibition at the
great World&rsquo;s Fair. Here the B &amp; O was commended for its wonderful historical
display, and people by the thousands came and looked at us and
made remarks about how small we were compared to modern locomotives
and went away. We had our brief hour of glory, and after the
show, they hauled us back to Martinsburg and put us away to rust.
Andy&mdash;I mean Atlantic&mdash;was cleaned up and sent to the St. Louis Fair
in 1904, where the B &amp; O was awarded a special gold medal for the most
complete transportation display, and then, in 1927, he and John were
taken to the Fair of the Iron Horse. Marty and I thought we were going
to be in that show. They brought us to Baltimore, but changed their
minds about us. We were in really bad shape! And when they sent the
two of us to the Wicomico Street scrap yards, my heart jumped right up
on top of my crown sheet. Surely, this was the end!</p>

<p>But as the years dragged on, and we still sat on the siding, our upper
parts crated over, we displayed that kind of patience that only an old
locomotive is capable of as he sits for long tedious hours on the shop
track, waiting for the day when he will be fixed up and running again.
We did get a thrill of expectancy when we were moved to Bailey&rsquo;s
Museum, but there we sat in a corner and nothing was done to fix us
up. I was ashamed when visitors saw me in such a condition. I would
wince at the remarks they made about our junky appearance. It was
worse for Marty, his beautiful grasshopper legs gone, and with those
dummy tin cylinders bolted to his frame to make him look like a &ldquo;crab&rdquo;

<p>One day in April, 1947, they hustled me to the Mt. Clare Shops. I
was completely bewildered. I didn&rsquo;t recognize the old shops where I had
been built 112 years ago and where I had worked up to 1892. Everything
was so much larger, and the great machines and cranes! And those
big locomotives! Wow! Anyway, they began to work on me, and I soon
realized that I was being changed back to the way I looked in 1892,
before Major Pangborn had me changed to resemble (ugh!) the &ldquo;Traveller.&rdquo;
Then, from the conversations I overheard, I pieced out the story,
which is something like this:</p>
<p>Col. E. A. Deeds (there&rsquo;s a nice man, if ever there was one, and
interested in preserving a good old locomotive!), Chairman of the
Board of The National Cash Register Company of Dayton, Ohio, was
planning to establish a museum in Carillon Park in that city. And one
of the things he needed was an old locomotive&mdash;and I was available
and willing.</p>

great importance and one in
which old No. 1 proudly participated.
The President of the
United States witnessed the
arrival of the cavalcade led
by the &ldquo;Atlantic.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>So I was reconditioned and painted up until I could hardly believe 55
long years had passed. Then they pushed me out to the old Mt. Clare
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Station and photographed me. Goodness me, how memories flooded
back over the years. The day, for instance, in 1835, when we lined up
there before that same station for the first trip into Washington, D. C.
I surely did feel proud, standing there having my picture taken.</p>

<p class="pcap">The Thomas Viaduct on the B &amp; O between Baltimore and Washington spanning the
Patapsco River is the oldest railroad stone viaduct in the world. Built in 1835, many
said it would not even support the three-and-a-half-ton Grasshoppers. Yet it has never
faltered under the heaviest of modern trains.</p>
</div>
<p>So, once more I found myself on a gondola, riding in style over the
mountains to the West. And finally I reached Dayton on November 6.
Then the celebration began. A big crane lifted me, light as you please,
out of the car on to a heavy trailer that was used to haul me over to the
park. And who do you think was down at the siding to welcome me?
None other than Colonel Deeds, himself! And with him were Messrs.
E. D. Smith, NCR plant engineer; R. H. Hagerman, NCR traffic
manager; Carl Beust, head of NCR Patent Department; T. J. Klauenberg,
B &amp; O division superintendent; C. P. Mabie, B &amp; O division freight
agent, and M. C. Schwab, B &amp; O freight agent. They were so pleased at
my coming to town that they had a big luncheon to celebrate, and my
picture was in the papers and everything.</p>
<p>And you should see the beautiful house they built for me at the Park.
It looks just like an old railroad station, except I am inside instead of
the passengers. It is built on part of the old railroad on the south bank
of the old Miami and Erie Canal. It&rsquo;s a beautiful setting in which to
house an old locomotive as important as I am.</p>
<p>So, here I am, proud as a peacock in my new home. Come out and
see me sometime. I expect to be here for a long, long time. As long as
America is a great, free country&mdash;forever, I hope!</p>

only five years later. In 1877, official operation of the canal ended.

<h3>Railroad Celebration.</h3>
<p>The opening of the Cincinnati, Hamilton and
Dayton Railroad, better designated perhaps as
the &ldquo;Great Miami Railway,&rdquo; which took place
yesterday, attracted thousands of people to
Dayton from the surrounding country. Business
was in a great measure suspended, and
crowds of spectators on the line of the road
were anxiously awaiting the arrival of the trains
from Cincinnati long before the hour fixed for
their coming. But we are anticipating.</p>
<p>In accordance with the arrangements, a train
of cars with 500 passengers left Dayton for
Hamilton at quarter past 7, on Thursday morning.
The morning was exceedingly pleasant,
the party in excellent spirit, a fine road to pass
over, and a most important event to commemorate.
A ride of two hours and a half through
a beautiful country, brought the train to Hamilton.
As it passed into town, thousands were
assembled to greet its appearance, banners
were stretched across the streets, having appropriate
inscriptions, and all wore the appearance
of festivity and rejoicing. Inspiring music,
the thunder of artillery and the shouts of
the assembled multitude, made the scene one
of thrilling interest and excitement.</p>
<p>Our Hamilton friends had made ample preparations
to refresh and entertain their guests
from Dayton as well as from Cincinnati.</p>
<p>While awaiting the arrival of the trains from
the city, invitations were freely tendered to
our citizens by Hon. <span class="sc">L. D. Campbell</span>, Col. <span class="sc">A.
P. Miller</span> and others, to partake of their hospitalities.
Many accepted the invitations, and
were entertained in the most munificent style.</p>
<p>The trains from Cincinnati having arrived,
&ldquo;the procession&rdquo; was formed and amidst the
booming of the cannon and the shouts of the
multitude, the four locomotives, with nearly
fifty cars in their trains, were soon under way
for Dayton. Proceeding at a moderate speed,
all arrived safely in Dayton at half past 2.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Programme, a procession
was formed under the direction of Col.
<span class="sc">Greer</span>, Grand Marshal, which proceeded to the
front of the Court House, where the Mayor of
the city, <span class="sc">John Howard</span>, Esq., in a brief and appropriate
speech extended a cordial welcome
to our guests. <span class="sc">S. S. L&rsquo;Hommedieu</span>, Esq., the
President of the Great Miami Railway, responded
in happy terms to the welcome of the Mayor.</p>
<p>The assembly separated for dinner, and all
we believe were entertained at public tables,
or at the houses of our citizens.</p>
<p>Towards 4 o&rsquo;clock, one of the trains started
on the return, and by 5 two others had departed.
A locomotive with several cars, remained
to take such of our visitors as remained to spend
the night in Dayton. All the trains which
left yesterday, safely reached the city and their
arrival there was telegraphed as soon as ascertained.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Serious Accidents.</h3>
<p>A little girl fell through the railroad bridge
yesterday morning, but was not much injured
by the fall.</p>
<p>A gentleman from Cincinnati, in endeavoring
to climb upon the second train while it
was under way, had his foot caught by a wheel
and badly mutilated.</p>
<p>An Irishman in the employ of the Cincinnati
Railroad Company, while coming up the track
last night in a hand car met with a serious accident.
While turning the crank, it broke and
he was precipitated forward with great force,
and so much injured that his life is considered
in danger.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Accident to S. S. L&rsquo;Hommedieu, Esq.</h3>
<p>Just as the last train was leaving for Cincinnati,
an accident occurred which had well
nigh proved fatal to <span class="sc">S. S. L&rsquo;Hommedieu</span>, Esq.,
the efficient President of the road now opened.
The &ldquo;Red Artillery&rdquo; of Cincinnati occupied
the last car of the train, and were firing their
small gun as the train started. The muzzle
of the piece was elevated, the charge poured
in, but luckily was not wadded. The piece
was depressed till about within range of the
heads of the spectators, and was fired in the
midst of a hundred persons standing by. Mr.
L&rsquo;Hommedieu was passing within a few feet
of and directly in front of the cannon&rsquo;s mouth,
as the match was applied. The principal part
of the charge struck his hat, but a part entered
his face. He was prostrated by the concussion,
but was soon upon his feet again. He was immediately
taken in a buggy to the residence
of <span class="sc">E. W. Davies</span>, Esq., and after a night of quiet
and repose was enabled to be about this morning.
His eyes are much inflamed, so that
they cannot hear the light, and his face is filled
with powder. He left for Cincinnati in the
train this morning. We hope soon to hear of
his entire recovery.</p>

<p class="pcap">George H. Corliss</p>
<p class="pcapc">Born in North Easton, Washington
County, New York, George H.
Corliss started out to work in a
general store. At twenty-one he
was the proprietor of his own store.
It was an incident which happened
there that set him forth on a career
as an inventor. A customer
complained of a pair of boots which
ripped at the seams. Corliss thought
there ought to be a better way to
sew and in the process of trying
to find it, invented a sewing machine
in 1843, three years before
Elias Howe received his patent.
That was his first step as an inventor
and it was followed by many
other inventions.</p>
</div>
<p>The Corliss steam engine improvements, at the time of their invention
and for many years thereafter, represented the most effective device ever
designed for economizing in the use of steam and regulating the steadiness
of a steam engine&rsquo;s power and speed. These were essential steps if man
was to harness the power of steam and turn it to practical use.</p>
<p>Before the advent of the Corliss engine, those engines which were
available were very wasteful in their use of fuel to produce steam and
its resultant power. They were also unable to maintain even speeds in
driving factory machinery and other units. This uneven flow of power
was a serious handicap to those who wanted to use steam to turn the
wheels of industry.</p>
<p>The secret of the efficiency of the Corliss engine lay in its most
distinctive feature ... the Corliss cut-off valve gear. The cut-off was
automatically controlled by the governor regardless of power variations
and without any slowing in speed. This was fundamentally responsible
for the Corliss&rsquo; efficiency and savings in fuel. So efficient was the engine
that the inventor often agreed to sell his product under an agreement
that the saving in fuel cost by the end of a certain period would
be its price. In one case, after the engine had run through the stated
period of two years, the purchaser was glad to pay twice the list price
rather than the much higher amount represented by actual savings.</p>
<p>The Corliss engine has played no small part in the development of
Dayton industry. Two such engines were used by The National Cash
Register Company for almost fifty years. One of these has been placed
in Carillon Park. In the next few pages this faithful worker for industrial
progress tells some of its experiences.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">The Story of My Life</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p class="smaller b">Personal reminiscences of the Corliss engine in Carillon Park, covering
nearly fifty years of continuous service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For quite awhile now, I have been sitting over here in Carillon Park
and I expect to go on doing that for some years to come. When you
weigh a couple of hundred tons you don&rsquo;t move around any more than
you have to and once you find a good spot you are likely to &ldquo;stay put.&rdquo;
Through the windows of my comfortable little power house I look out
at my neighbors across the way. One of them is a Grasshopper locomotive
which I can just see through the windows of his &ldquo;station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually met &ldquo;Grasshopper&rdquo; but I did learn not long ago
that he has written the story of his life. I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to say
that he was &ldquo;blowing off steam&rdquo; but it does seem to me that if he has
a story to tell I should have one too. Of course, I know that size doesn&rsquo;t
mean everything, but if you should weigh old &ldquo;Grasshopper&rdquo;&mdash;wheels,
cab and all&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t weigh nearly as much as my flywheel. But I
feel that we do have several things in common ... we both know what
it means to get all steamed up and we have both done a lot of work
in our day.</p>
<p>My friend &ldquo;Grasshopper&rdquo; has traveled quite a bit but I think he has
settled down now, just like me. They say that a rolling stone gathers no
moss and certainly &ldquo;Grasshopper&rdquo; is bright and shiny but I don&rsquo;t believe
you will find much moss on me either.</p>

<p class="pcap">Part of the Corliss on its way to the NCR power house in 1902. Five teams were
required to move it.</p>
</div>
<p>My ancestry doesn&rsquo;t go back quite as far as &ldquo;Grasshopper&rsquo;s&rdquo; but the
difference is only about thirteen years, at that. He was born in 1835
and was the second generation of his family. True enough, I came along
a good many years later but my forefathers reach back to 1848, for in
that year the Corliss line was begun. In the following year, on March 10,
1849, Mr. George H. Corliss, a remarkable man whose name I bear, was
granted his first patent for steam engine improvements embodying his
famous &ldquo;drop cut-off valve gear.&rdquo; He had developed some new ideas
about steam engines, mostly about making them run steadier and on less
coal. Those ideas meant a lot to industry all over this country. Outside
of the teammate who worked next to me in the NCR power house for
years, I never met any of my brothers but I am sure they were all hard
workers who gave a good account of themselves.</p>
<p>Like anybody else, I don&rsquo;t remember much about my birth. I was
built in Mount Vernon, Ohio, by the C. &amp; G. Cooper Company, which
manufactured Corliss engines. My various pieces never really met until
they all came together in the NCR power house back there in 1902. As
I remember, it was a rather bumpy ride from the freight yards to the
NCR factory but I felt quite important. Who wouldn&rsquo;t, with five teams
of horses pulling you along and people stopping to look at you all along
the way. I gather that I was considered quite a fellow in engine circles
in those days and I guess folks figured if the people at NCR went out
and hired a big engine like me to work for them business must be good
and expected to get better.</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t know who figured out all the intricate variations in my
anatomy but I have heard that E. A. Deeds, who was an engineer at
NCR in those days, asked them to put in some special features which he
thought would make me better. Those ideas must have been all right, for
I have never known a sick day in my life. And for the record, let me
say that I was running full speed right up to the moment I was shut
off, in 1948. That had happened before when they made me stop to
be looked over but they always let me start up again. Glad I didn&rsquo;t
know what was happening that day for I certainly had no idea of
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
quitting, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have liked the idea a bit. Of course, I came
out all right, but for a while things looked pretty dark, I can tell you.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig25">
<img src="images/p09a.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="700" />
<p class="pcap">The Corliss as it looked in the NCR power house in 1902 where it functioned
for almost fifty years with never a single failure.</p>
</div>
<p>As a matter of fact, according to the story I have pieced together
from chance bits of conversation, I missed the scrap heap by just a
hair. It seems there was some idea of putting only my fly wheel in
Carillon Park, because they didn&rsquo;t quite want to see me pass out altogether.
Then one day, Colonel Deeds got the idea of putting all of me over here.
He said there were not too many Corliss engines around and
that we were getting fewer every year. He figured that future generations
ought to know what we looked like, because we had done a good job.
So, in the nick of time, he saved me. Nick of time is right! It was a
matter of hours. The scrap man had already been out to look me over
and I could almost feel the hot breath of the acetylene torch eating
right into me.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig26">
<img src="images/p09c.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="516" />
<p class="pcap">On March 13, 1948, Colonel
E. A. Deeds turned the control
wheel which shut down the
Corliss for the last time. It
was an act which brought
with it many memories for
him because 46 years before
he had turned that same
wheel in the reverse direction
for the first time and brought
the Corliss to life.</p>
</div>
<p>Now maybe before I go any further, I should tell you what I did for
almost fifty years at NCR. I really had two jobs: one to turn out electric
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
power and the other to heat the factory with my exhaust steam, which
you might say I did with my left hand. That&rsquo;s one reason they always
liked me. I used a lot of coal&mdash;guess I&rsquo;ve burned up about 175,000 tons
in my day&mdash;but I never wasted it. I got just about as much out of a ton
of coal as I possibly could and then I did that extra job of heating the
factory with my exhaust steam for practically nothing.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="542" />
<p class="pcap">The Corliss moves again but this time one powerful motor truck with heavy-duty
trailer is sufficient to do the job.</p>
</div>
<p>I could tell you a lot about some of the things that happened during
my almost half century on the job. Of course I saw NCR grow up.
When I went to work in the power house there were just 5 buildings in
the whole plant. When they took me out I was amazed at how the
place had changed. I had seen some of the new buildings out the window
but by no means all of them. There are over 30 now. And what a
lot more people there are! I think there were about 2,000 in 1902 and
now there are 15,000. Well, I like to think I did my share in helping
things along.</p>
<p>About eleven years after I started to work, a terrible thing happened
to Dayton. I am talking about the flood of 1913, and while I didn&rsquo;t get
wet, I knew the situation was bad. You see, the water knocked out the
power houses downtown and my friends and I in the NCR power house
had to step in and take over. Of course we were glad to do it and those
days remain one of the great experiences of my life, but I wouldn&rsquo;t want
to go through that again. Or see the fine people of Dayton go through
it either. Fortunately nobody needs to worry any more, for I understand
they have fixed up that flood business for good.</p>
<p>I know people don&rsquo;t like too many figures, but I&rsquo;d like to give you
just a few about myself. As you see me today, I weigh 210 tons. My
flywheel is twenty feet in diameter and weighs 38 tons. When I was
working full speed I turned out 800 kilowatts. According to people
who should know and who looked me over just before I moved over
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
here, I was in just about as good shape when I went out as when I
went in. Give me a little steam and my two old friends, Tom Monks
and Ross Morgan, to look after me and I&rsquo;d be right back in business.</p>
<p>You know, there is an interesting point of difference between Grasshopper&rsquo;s
experience and mine. He went onto the side track because bigger
and more powerful engines took his job away from him. Well up to a
point my experience was the same; the fellow who&rsquo;s doing my job now
is certainly more powerful&mdash;about six times as strong&mdash;much as I hate
to admit it. But the funny part of it is, he&rsquo;s a midget compared to me.
Naturally, I haven&rsquo;t been back to the power house since I left, but they
tell me this fellow, whose name is Turbine, something or other, is hardly
more than a good-sized bump on the power house floor. He weighs only
one-fifth of what I do. Doesn&rsquo;t seem possible that he can get more done
than I did, but I know times change, and I guess engines, like everything
else, change with them. Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m critical; more power to
him. If things keep on growing around there, he&rsquo;s going to need it. But
I just have a little hope way down deep, that once in a while someone
is going to look over that way and think back to the days when they
could see my old flywheel whirling around day and night, trying to
keep things going.</p>
<p>You know, when you have spent your life trying to do the right
thing, you like to feel that you have done a good job. Do you know the
last thing they said about me, just before I moved? This is part of the
Company&rsquo;s records so it&rsquo;s official and it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ll always remember.
Here it is: &ldquo;This engine has given excellent service and no power
interruptions were ever experienced due to failure of this unit.&rdquo; That
makes a fellow feel pretty good and being over here in Carillon Park,
looking shinier even than when I was on the job, makes me feel good,
too. I know I am going to meet a lot of fine people and I hope they&rsquo;ll
enjoy coming in and looking me over. You know, I think that even
for a Corliss ... I&rsquo;m a very lucky fellow.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
